You’ve been asked to help a local watering hole, Ye Olde Pub, display their beer menu on their web app. The API to retrieve information about each beer to display is here: https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers. You’re free to be creative with layout, styling, and content, but there are a few requirements you must satisfy:

The name of each beer must be shown on the menu, along with its ABV and IBU. You may use and/or display any other additional information from the API, as long as those required pieces are there.
The most popular beers are Electric India, Vice Bier, and Storm. Choose a distinct layout and/or style for these beers to make sure they are more prominently featured and easily distinguishable from the other options. They should also appear together at the top of the menu.
The rest of the beers should be sorted by ABV, where the beer with the highest ABV (The End of History) appears at the bottom of the menu.
Tips:

You may import libraries using https://unpkg.com/. If you wanted to use Axios, for example, you’d add a script tag to the HTML pane with the following URL: https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js
import statements won’t work in your JS code. When calling functions from libraries you’re importing, make sure to include the module prefix (e.g. React.useState)
You can choose between popular frameworks (React, Angular, Vue) by clicking on the “Packages” link at the top of the left hand pane.
If you’re using React, you might need to wrap your root component in a fragment in the ReactDOM.render call, e.g. ReactDOM.render(<><MyComponent /></>, document.getElementById('root'));
